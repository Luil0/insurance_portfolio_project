This project was from codecademy, I used my knowledge of python to inspect the medical insuarnce charges dataset. These were the goals for the project:

1. Find out if the dataset represents every attribute fairly.
2. Determine how many patients each reagion has.
3. Determine the average charges for all patients and male and female average charegs.
4. Which categroy has the highest charges on average.
5. Find out which attribute has the highest charges.
